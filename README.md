## Synopsis

This application is designed to create a link between leboncoin.fr and meilleursagents.com to be able to evaluate an ad. This is made by doing a comparison on the price by squared meter between the ad and the average regional statistics.

## Installation

```shell
npm install --save 
```

## Tests

```shell
npm start
```

Go to http://localhost:3000/

Then fill the form with an url.

If it is a good deal you can save it to your ads. Then from ads view you can delete those you don't want anymore.
